TicTacToe Java

#part1
1. create main class, TicTacToe class
2. create array,constructor(initialize the array, board) for board and also call initboard method
3. create initboard(initialize with character) method to initialize board to null(involves loop)
4. create a method to display board(same loop as in 3)
5. create object and display board
6. create placemark method with 3 parameters and include condition for invalid address in array
7. first ensure that first character is not equal to empty character and create colwin and rowwin and diagonalwin methods to check for win

Human Player
{
AI player
{
  name:string
  mark : char

methods:

makemove(){take input from user until it is valid using do-while loop, call putmark}
isvalidmove(){check whether given row,col are in allowed range and also check if the given square has empty, access board using static}
}
}


AI player
{
  name:string
  mark : char

methods:

makemove(){code using random}
isvalidmove(){check whether given row,col are in allowed range and also check if the given square has empty, access board using static}
}



inside LaunchGame keep an eye on which player is playing

access all the methods using static and check for win inside LaunchGame

use inheritance and increase reusability

using while run loop in LaunchGame to run game until one has won

include draw condition
